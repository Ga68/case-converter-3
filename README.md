# case converter 3
 Alfred Case Converter workflow


  Now featuring Universal Action triggers and hotkeys for the following five actions:


- Uppercase

- Lowercase

- Capitalize - capitalizes **all** words (e.g. Posting A New Topic In Share Your Workflows)

- Title Case - capitalizes word except for "the", "in", "of" etc. according to American English title conventions (e.g. Posting a New Topic in Share Your Workflows),  If you manage academic citations with BibDesk, Zotero, Papers, Mendeley, etc., Title Case conversion is especially useful for cleaning up downloaded citations.


- Sentence Case - capitalizes only the first letter of the first word & converts the rest to lower case

  


All of these are set to Copy to Clipboard and Paste by default.

  


There's also a script filter **cc** which lets you view the query converted and select your choice (like the [Code Case](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/4818-code-case/) workflow).

  


You can also connect a hot key directly to the **cc** script filter directly to view the output options without typing the **cc** command and pasting your text.
